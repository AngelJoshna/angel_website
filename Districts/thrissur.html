               <p>Thrissur formerly Trichur, also known by its historical name Thrissivaperur, is a city and the headquarters of the Thrissur district in Kerala, India. It is the fourth largest city in Kerala after Trivandrum, Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India. It is famous for the Thrissur Pooram festival.[3][4] The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats the Vadakkumnathan temple. It is located 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Trivandrum. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. Thrissur is known as "Cultural Capital of Kerala" due of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history.[5] One of its main cultural events is the Thrissur Pooram, which attracts quite a number of tourists and travellers.

                Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history. It contains the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy, Kerala Lalithakala Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Academy.[8] The city hosts the Thrissur Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple festival in Kerala.[9][10] The festival is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan in April or May, in the Malayalam month 'medam'.[7] Thrissur Pooram was not conducted in the year 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thrissur has a large number of well-known temples including the Vadakkumnathan temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple and Paramekkavu temple, and the Guruvayur temple as well as two churches, the Our Lady of Lourdes Syro-Malabar Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral and the Our Lady of Dolours Syro-Malabar Catholic Basilica, the largest Christian church in India.</p>
